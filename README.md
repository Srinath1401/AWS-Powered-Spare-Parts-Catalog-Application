# AWS-Powered-Spare-Parts-Catalog-Application
Project Description:
AWS 3 Tier Web-Application This cloud-based project is a Spare Parts Catalog Management System 
developed and deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application 
allows users to enter and manage spare part details such as part name, part 
number, price, and quantity through a web-based interface. The frontend is hosted 
on an EC2 instance and served using Nginx, while the backend is built with 
Node.js and Express and exposed through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) 
to handle incoming requests. Data is securely stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL 
database deployed in a private subnet, ensuring isolation and security. All AWS 
resources, including VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2, ALB, and RDS, were 
created and configured manually using the AWS Management Console, providing 
hands-on experience with real-world cloud infrastructure, networking, and 
security practices.
